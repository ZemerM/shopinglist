#################################
# READ ME FIRST:
#
# This is an example extension descriptor that deploys the app in SaaS multitenancy mode.
# In order to deploy this to your space, you will need to adjust the parameters for your space's properties (identity zone, the generated tenant id within the client id).
# The example works for direct deployment in the canary trial space.
#
# When deploying to an org other than the AWS Canary Trial org, you will need to adjust this example to the right identityzone and client id suffix (note: these are the same
# for all spaces within an org, so you can reuse them once you know them).
# To determine the info, do the following commands when logged in to a space in the target org:
#
#   cf create-service xsuaa application temp
#   cf create-service-key temp dummy
#   cf service-key temp dummy
#
# The last command will dump the XSUAA configuration for this service key. From the JSON, take the value of "identityzone" and memorize the suffix from the "xsappname" 
# (the characters following the exclamation mark, like "!t27").
# Afterwards, clean up via:
#
#   cf delete-service-key temp dummy
#   cf delete-service temp

    # When using the application shared plan for XSUAA, the PaaS tenant is available by prefixing the identity zone name to the default hostname. 
    # This example hence contains cc-sap as prefix which fits the Canary trial space's identity zone for multitenancy.
